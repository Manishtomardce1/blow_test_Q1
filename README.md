    2. Work with testor for test driven development
    3. Come up with design solutions which follows solid, dry, kiss principles or can be solved using design patterns.
    4. Test after development and writing unit test cases
    5. Work with testor if it satisfies functional requirements as mentioned on task
    6. Push the changes to test/dev/qa environment and identifies/test the story
    7. push it to production
